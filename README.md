# plantMonitoringSystem

This code allows to monitoring the environmental conditions as well as the health of a plant throughout its life. This can be useful in greenhouses by monitoring several plants randomly.

The project is based on the B-L072Z-LRWAN1 LoRa®/Sigfox™ Discovery kit and several sensors
